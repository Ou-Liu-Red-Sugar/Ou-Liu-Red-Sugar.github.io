This page collects a selection of my mathematical notes.
Some shorter or less organized notes are written directly on the homepage.

## PDF Notes

- **Galois Cover**

  Seminar notes on Galois covers, prepared for the
  [Galois Theory in Algebra and Topology Seminar](https://hellus.app.uni-regensburg.de/KVV/abruflink.php?id=1387).

  [PDF](/papers/notes/Galois_cover.pdf)

- **Stable Dold–Kan Correspondence**

  Seminar notes on the stable Dold–Kan correspondence, from the
  [Goodwillie Calculus Seminar](https://hoyois.app.uni-regensburg.de/WS26/calculus/index.html).

  [PDF](/papers/notes/StableDoldKan.pdf)

- **Higher Topos Theory**

  Lecture notes for the course
  [Higher Topos Theory](https://hoyois.app.uni-regensburg.de/WS26/htt/index.html),
  taught by Marc Hoyois in the Winter Term 2025/26.

  These notes do not closely follow the lecture schedule. I plan to spend more
  time polishing them after the course, and for now readers may prefer
  [Bastiaan’s notes](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vLD4BlS6zlu1SW4Hmvd2V6tgxV5a96Q0/view).

- **A Brief Introduction to Monads and Higher Algebra**

  Notes on higher algebra, partly rewritten using the language of algebraic
  patterns, together with an exposition of the Lurie–Barr–Beck theorem and the
  theory of descendable objects developed by Akhil Mathew.
