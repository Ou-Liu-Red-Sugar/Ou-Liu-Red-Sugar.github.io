This page collects a selection of my mathematical notes, including seminar notes,
lecture notes, and expository material related to algebra, topology, and higher
category theory.

More informal or exploratory notes are maintained directly on the homepage and
are listed separately below.

## PDF Notes

- **Galois Cover**

  Seminar notes on Galois covers, prepared for the  
  [Galois Theory in Algebra and Topology Seminar](https://hellus.app.uni-regensburg.de/KVV/abruflink.php?id=1387).

  [PDF](/papers/notes/Galois_cover.pdf)

- **Stable Dold–Kan Correspondence**

  Seminar notes on the stable Dold–Kan correspondence, prepared for the 
  [ Goodwillie Calculus Seminar ](https://hoyois.app.uni-regensburg.de/WS26/calculus/index.html).

  Online version: {{< pageref "notes/StableDoldKan.md" "Stable Dold-Kan and Descent" >}}  
  [PDF](/papers/notes/StableDoldKan.pdf)

- **Higher Topos Theory**

  Lecture notes for the course  
  [Higher Topos Theory](https://hoyois.app.uni-regensburg.de/WS26/htt/index.html),
  taught by Marc Hoyois in the Winter Term 2025/26.

  These notes do not closely follow the lecture schedule. They will be further
  polished after the course; in the meantime, readers may prefer
  [Bastiaan’s notes](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vLD4BlS6zlu1SW4Hmvd2V6tgxV5a96Q0/view).

- **A Brief Introduction to Monads and Higher Algebra**

  Notes on higher algebra, partly rewritten using the language of algebraic
  patterns, together with an exposition of the Lurie–Barr–Beck theorem and the
  theory of descendable objects developed by Akhil Mathew.
