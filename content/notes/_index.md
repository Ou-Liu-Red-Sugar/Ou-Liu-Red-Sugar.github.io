This page collects a selection of my mathematical notes, including seminar notes,
lecture notes, and expository material in algebra, topology, and higher category
theory.

More informal or exploratory notes are maintained on the homepage and are listed
separately below.

## PDF Notes

- **Galois Covers**  
  Seminar notes prepared for the  
  [Galois Theory in Algebra and Topology Seminar](https://hellus.app.uni-regensburg.de/KVV/abruflink.php?id=1387).  
  [PDF](/papers/notes/Galois_cover.pdf)

- **Stable Dold–Kan Correspondence**  
  Seminar notes prepared for the  
  [Goodwillie Calculus Seminar](https://hoyois.app.uni-regensburg.de/WS26/calculus/index.html).  
  Online version: {{< pageref "notes/StableDoldKan.md" "Stable Dold–Kan and Descent" >}}  
  [PDF](/papers/notes/StableDoldKan.pdf)

- **Higher Topos Theory**  
  Lecture notes for the course  
  [Higher Topos Theory](https://hoyois.app.uni-regensburg.de/WS26/htt/index.html), taught by Marc Hoyois
  in Winter Term 2025/26.  

  These notes do not closely follow the lecture schedule. They will be further polished after the
  course; in the meantime, readers may prefer
  [Bastiaan’s notes](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vLD4BlS6zlu1SW4Hmvd2V6tgxV5a96Q0/view).  
  [PDF](/papers/notes/HTTNote.pdf)

- **A Brief Introduction to Monads and Higher Algebra**  
  Notes on higher algebra, partly rewritten using the language of algebraic patterns, together with an
  exposition of the Lurie–Barr–Beck theorem and the theory of descendable objects developed by Akhil Mathew.  
  [PDF](/papers/notes/Monad.pdf)

- **Algebraic Geometry**  
  Lecture notes for  
  [Algebraic Geometry I](https://hoyois.app.uni-regensburg.de/WS26/alggeo1/index.html), taught by Marc Hoyois
  in Winter Term 2025/26.  

  Marc provides a script, but it omits most proofs; these notes supply detailed proofs and additional
  exposition.
