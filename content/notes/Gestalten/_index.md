  Notes on Gestalten and higher-categorical geometry following Scholze's Geometry and Higher Category Theory.
---

These notes are organized around the framework introduced in *Geometry and Higher Category Theory*, a series of lectures by **Peter Scholze** (Winter 2025/26). The goal in that work is to develop a workable theory of geometric objects in a higher-categorical setting, in which the duality between geometry and algebra is fully extended.

A central theme in Scholze’s introduction is that classical dualities between geometric objects and algebraic structures — such as affine schemes and commutative rings — suggest a deeper phenomenon: if one enlarges the class of “affine objects” appropriately and takes opposites, the resulting category of affines *already behaves like a topos*, without the need to impose an external Grothendieck topology.

In this perspective, one considers algebraic objects such as **Stefanich rings** and more general higher-categorical algebraic structures, and looks at their opposites as “Gestalten”, a German term meaning “shapes” or “forms”, to emphasize that they are not merely stacks in the classical sense, but geometric objects in their own right.

This setup aims to unify different flavors of geometry — algebraic, analytic, and beyond — under a single higher-categorical umbrella:  
- the opposite category of sufficiently structured algebraic objects acquires canonical topos-like properties,  
- six-functor formalisms extend naturally,  
- and classical objects such as schemes, stacks, and analytic stacks appear as special cases of this enhanced geometry.

The material here is developed progressively, beginning with presentable categories and their κ-compact generation, moving through six-functor formalism and Stefanich rings, and culminating in the construction and study of Gestalten.
