  This note constructs the six-functor formalism on \(n\mathsf{Pr}_{(-)}\), shows that it is sheafy with respect to fpqc topology, and then extends the theory from affine schemes of derived rings to stacks.

## Six-Functor Formalisms on \(n\mathsf{Pr}_{(-)}\)

Let  $\mathsf{CAlg}$ be the category of derived rings, and let $\mathsf{Aff} \coloneqq \mathsf{CAlg}^{\operatorname{op}}$ be the category of affine schemes.
