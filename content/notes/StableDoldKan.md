# Introduction

{{< remark title="Conventions" >}}
Throughout this talk, we adopt the following conventions:
- *Implicit ∞-categories:* For the sake of readability, we systematically omit the prefix “∞-” from our terminology. Thus, unless stated otherwise, the term *category* always refers to an ∞-category.
- *1-categories:* To avoid confusion, we refer to ordinary categories (i.e., those enriched over sets) explicitly as *1-categories*.
- *Homological indexing:* We use *homological* indexing for chain complexes. In particular, the differential on any chain complex, $\partial_n: C_n \to C_{n-1}$, lowers the degree by $1$.
- *Simplex category:* We use $\Delta$ to denote the standard *simplex category*.
{{< /remark >}}

## Overview and Structure

These notes accompany a talk given at the *[Goodwillie Calculus Seminar](https://hoyois.app.uni-regensburg.de/WS26/calculus/index.html)*, held in the Winter Term 2025 at the University of Regensburg.

Our primary objective is two-fold:
1. To provide a self-contained introduction to and proof of the *stable Dold–Kan correspondence*.
2. To demonstrate its power by applying it to *descent theory*, specifically relating descendable algebras to nilpotent Adams towers.

The notes are organized as follows:
- *Section “Classical Dold–Kan”*: We begin by warming up with the classical story. We review the correspondence between simplicial objects and chain complexes in additive 1-categories.
- *Section “The stable setup”*: We shift to the stable categorical setting. We explain why, in this context, the natural analogue of a chain complex is a $\mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0}$-filtration.
- *Chapter “The proof”*: This is the technical heart of the talk. We construct the “bridge categories” $\mathcal{J}$ and $\mathcal{J}_+$ to prove that simplicial objects are equivalent to filtrations.
- *Appendix “Application to descent”*: Finally, we reap the rewards of our hard work. We apply the stable Dold–Kan correspondence to the theory of *descendable algebras*. We will show how this correspondence translates the difficult problem of descent (convergence of the *cobar construction*) into a manageable problem of nilpotence (vanishing of the Adams tower), culminating in the descendable Barr–Beck theorem.

## Review of the Classical Dold–Kan Correspondence

We begin with a motivating example from topology.

{{< construction >}}
Let $X$ be a topological space. We can construct a simplicial set $\operatorname{Sing}_{\bullet}(X)$ as follows: for $[n] \in \Delta$, define $\operatorname{Sing}_n(X) \coloneqq \operatorname{Hom}_{\mathsf{Top}}(\Delta^n_{\operatorname{top}}, X)$, where $\Delta^n_{\operatorname{top}}$ denotes the *topological $n$-simplex*.
{{< /construction >}}

This defines a functor
\[
\operatorname{Sing} \colon \mathsf{Top} \to \mathsf{sSet}.
\]
This functor induces an equivalence between classical homotopy theory and simplicial homotopy theory:
\[
\mathsf{Top}[\text{weak homotopy equivalence}^{-1}] \simeq \mathsf{An}.
\]

However, for computational purposes, we often want to “linearize” this homotopy data.
We can form the free abelian group generated by the $n$-simplices, denoted $\mathbb{Z} \operatorname{Sing}_n (X)$, obtaining a simplicial abelian group $\mathbb{Z} \operatorname{Sing}_{\bullet} (X)$.
While this object captures the homology of $X$, it contains redundant information: the degeneracy maps merely repeat lower-dimensional data, and the full collection of face maps is unwieldy.

To extract the homological data efficiently, we pass to the *singular chain complex* $\operatorname{C}_*(X)$:
- For each $n \ge 0$, let $\operatorname{C}_n(X) \coloneqq \mathbb{Z} \operatorname{Sing}_n(X)$.
- The differential $\partial_n \colon \operatorname{C}_n(X) \to \operatorname{C}_{n-1}(X)$ is defined as the alternating sum of the face maps:
\[
\partial_n \coloneqq \sum_{i=0}^n (-1)^i d_i^n,
\]
where $d_i^n$ is the $i$-th face map.

This yields a functor
\[
\operatorname{C}_* \colon \mathsf{sAb} \to \mathsf{Ch}_{\geq 0}(\mathsf{Ab}).
\]
While this functor captures the correct homology, it is *not* an equivalence of categories because it retains the degenerate simplices in its object definition.
However, if we quotient out the degenerate simplices, we obtain the *normalized chain complex* $\operatorname{N}_*(X)$. The celebrated *Dold–Kan correspondence* asserts that this normalization functor is an equivalence of categories.
Thus, in a very precise sense, *singular homology theory is the linearization of the homotopy theory of topological spaces*.

More formally, this correspondence establishes a fundamental relationship between connective chain complexes[^1] and simplicial objects in an idempotent-complete additive 1-category $\mathcal{A}$.

Given a simplicial object $X_{\bullet}$ in $\mathcal{A}$, one can construct its *unnormalized chain complex* (or Moore complex), denoted $\operatorname{C}_*(X)$, as follows:
- The object in degree $n$ is simply $\operatorname{C}_n(X) \coloneqq X_n$.
- The differential $\partial_n \colon \operatorname{C}_n(X) \to \operatorname{C}_{n-1}(X)$ is the alternating sum of face maps:
\[
\partial_n \coloneqq \sum_{i=0}^n (-1)^i d_i^n.
\]

This complex is “too large” as it contains redundant information from degenerate simplices. Let $\operatorname{D}_n(X)$ be the subobject of $X_n$ generated by all degenerate $n$-simplices.
A more efficient representation is given by the *normalized chain complex*, denoted $\operatorname{N}_*(X)$, defined by $\operatorname{N}_n(X) \coloneqq \bigcap_{i=1}^{n} \ker(d_i^n)$.
A fundamental result states that there is a canonical isomorphism $\operatorname{N}_n(X) \xrightarrow{\sim} \operatorname{C}_n(X)/\operatorname{D}_n(X)$, and the inclusion $\operatorname{N}_*(X) \hookrightarrow \operatorname{C}_*(X)$ is a quasi-isomorphism.

Conversely, we can construct a simplicial object from a connective chain complex $C_* \in \operatorname{Ch}(\mathcal{A})_{\geq 0}$. First, we form a semi-simplicial object $C_{\bullet,\operatorname{inj}}$:
{{< tikzcd >}}
    \cdots \ar[r,shift left=3,"\partial"]\ar[r,shift left=1]\ar[r,shift right= 1]\ar[r,shift right=3] & C_2 \ar[r, shift left = 2,"\partial"]\ar[r, shift left = 0]\ar[r, shift right = 2] & C_1 \ar[r, shift left = 1,"\partial"] \ar[r, shift right = 1] & C_0,
{{< /tikzcd >}}
where the arrow corresponding to the $i$-th coface operator $\delta_n^i \colon [n-1] \hookrightarrow [n]$ is $\partial$ if $i=0$ (or specific indices depending on convention) and zero otherwise.

We then obtain the corresponding simplicial object via the left Kan extension along the inclusion $\Delta_{\operatorname{inj}} \hookrightarrow \Delta$:
{{< tikzcd >}}
    \Delta_{\operatorname{inj}}^{\operatorname{op}} \ar[dr,"C_{\bullet,\operatorname{inj}}"]\ar[d,hook]\\
    \Delta^{\operatorname{op}} \ar[r,"\operatorname{DK}"] & \mathcal{A}.
{{< /tikzcd >}}
We refer to this functor $\operatorname{DK}$ as the *Dold–Kan construction*. Intuitively, this process “freely adds” the necessary degenerate simplices to the chain complex.

{{< theorem id="thm-classical-DK" title="Classical Dold–Kan correspondence" >}}
Let $\mathcal{A}$ be an additive 1-category. The functor
\[
\operatorname{DK} \colon \operatorname{Ch}(\mathcal{A})_{\geq 0} \to \operatorname{Fun}(\Delta^{\operatorname{op}},\mathcal{A})
\]
is fully faithful. Furthermore, if $\mathcal{A}$ is idempotent-complete, then $\operatorname{DK}$ and the normalization functor $\operatorname{N}_*$ constitute an equivalence of categories.
{{< /theorem >}}

{{< proof >}}
We verify this by reducing it to the abelian case. Recall that for $\mathcal{A} = \mathsf{Ab}$, the classical Dold–Kan correspondence holds (c.f. {{< cite HA "Lemma 1.2.3.13" >}}).

Now, let $\mathcal{A}$ be a general additive 1-category. Consider the category of additive presheaves $\mathcal{A}' = \operatorname{Fun}(\mathcal{A}^{\operatorname{op}},\mathsf{Ab})$. Via the additive Yoneda embedding $y \colon \mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{A}'$, we can embed $\mathcal{A}$ into an abelian category.
Since $y$ preserves finite limits and colimits, the following diagram commutes up to canonical isomorphism:
{{< tikzcd >}}
    \mathsf{Ch}(\mathcal{A})_{\geq 0} \ar[r,"\operatorname{DK}"] \ar[d,"y"] & \operatorname{Fun}(\Delta^{\operatorname{op}},\mathcal{A}) \ar[d,"y"]\\
    \mathsf{Ch}(\mathcal{A}')_{\geq 0} \ar[r,"\operatorname{DK}"] & \operatorname{Fun}(\Delta^{\operatorname{op}},\mathcal{A}').

{{< /tikzcd >}}

Now consider the bottom map. By the exponential law (or currying), we have $\mathsf{Ch}(\mathcal{A}')_{\geq 0} \cong \operatorname{Fun}(\mathcal{A}^{\operatorname{op}}, \mathsf{Ch}(\mathsf{Ab})_{\geq 0})$. Thus, the bottom functor corresponds to post-composition with the classical equivalence $\operatorname{DK}_{\mathsf{Ab}}$. Since post-composition with an equivalence is an equivalence, the bottom map is an equivalence.

Since $y$ is fully faithful, it follows that the top $\operatorname{DK}$ functor is fully faithful. The essential surjectivity in the idempotent-complete case follows from the splitting of $\operatorname{N}_n$ as a direct summand.
{{< /proof >}}

## What is the Stable Dold–Kan Correspondence?

We now shift our focus to the setting of higher category theory. In modern homotopy theory, *stable categories* serve as the higher categorical analogue of abelian categories.

Consider the homotopy category $\operatorname{h}\mathcal{C}$ of a stable category $\mathcal{C}$. While $\operatorname{h}\mathcal{C}$ is typically not abelian, it carries a *triangulated structure*. This implies two key properties:
1. $\operatorname{h}\mathcal{C}$ is an additive 1-category.
2. It satisfies the following splitting property:
   - $(*)$ *If $f \colon X \to Y$ is a morphism in $\operatorname{h}\mathcal{C}$ which admits a left inverse, then there is an isomorphism $Y \simeq X \oplus X'$ such that $f$ is identified with the inclusion into the first factor.*

This property guarantees that the classical Dold–Kan correspondence applies perfectly to $\operatorname{h}\mathcal{C}$ (allowing us to identify chain complexes in $\operatorname{h}\mathcal{C}$ with simplicial objects).

However, the *stable* correspondence is a much deeper statement at the full categorical level. The key insight is to relate simplicial objects to $\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$-*filtrations*. A functor $F_{\star} \colon \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0} \to \mathcal{C}$ represents a tower of objects:
\[
F_0 \to F_1 \to F_2 \to \cdots
\]

{{< construction >}}
Let $F_{\star}$ be a filtration in stable category $\mathcal{C}$, then for $s \in \Z$, one can define the *$s$-th associative graded piece* of $F_{\star}$ to be the cofiber
\[
\operatorname{gr}_{F}^{s} \coloneqq \operatorname{cofib}(F_{s} \to F_{s+1}) = \frac{F_{s+1}}{F_s}.
\]
In {{< cite HA "Remark 1.2.2.3" >}}, one can find that if $F_{\star}$ is a filtration, then the graded objects form a kind of chain complex. Specifically, each fiber sequence
\[
\operatorname{gr}^{s} \to \frac{F_{s+2}}{F_s} \to \operatorname{gr}^{s+1}
\]
gives rise to a ‘differential’ $d \colon \operatorname{gr}^{s+1} \to \operatorname{gr}^s[1]$.
{{< /construction >}}

Thus, one obtain a chain complex
\[
\cdots \to \operatorname{gr}^{2}[-2] \to \operatorname{gr}^1[-1] \to \operatorname{gr}^0 \to \operatorname{gr}^{-1}[1] \to \operatorname{gr}^{-2}[2] \to \cdots
\]

Using the classical Dold–Kan correspondence on $\operatorname{h}\mathcal{C}$, this chain complex determines a simplicial object. The *stable Dold–Kan correspondence* asserts that this relationship lifts to an equivalence of $\infty$-categories:

{{< theorem id="thm-stable-DK" title="Stable Dold–Kan correspondence" >}}
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a stable category. Then there exists an equivalence of categories:
\[
\operatorname{Fun}(\Delta^{\operatorname{op}},\mathcal{C}) \simeq \operatorname{Fun}(\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0},\mathcal{C}).
\]
{{< /theorem >}}

# Technical Lemmas {#chap:technical-lemmas}

In the proof of the stable Dold–Kan correspondence (Chapter “Stable-DK”), we relied on a crucial identification between left and right Kan extensions. The goal of this chapter is to provide a rigorous, model-independent proof of this fact.

{{< lemma id="lem-Kan-extension" title="Kan extension equivalence" >}}
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a stable category, let $n \geq 0$, and let $F \colon \Delta_{+,\leq n}^{\operatorname{op}} \to \mathcal{C}$ be a functor.
The following conditions are equivalent:
1. The functor $F$ is a left Kan extension of its restriction $F|_{\Delta_{\leq n}^{\operatorname{op}}}$.
2. The functor $F$ is a right Kan extension of its restriction $F|_{\Delta_{+,\leq n-1}^{\operatorname{op}}}$.
{{< /lemma >}}

To prove this, we need to analyze the combinatorics of the simplex category. We adopt the strategy of Yuchen Wu, which avoids the use of topological barycentric subdivisions.

## Coinitial

We first establish a general lemma regarding the contractibility of unions of posets.

{{< lemma id="lem-poset-contractibility" title="Union of Contractible Posets" >}}
Let $V$ be a poset and let $\mathcal{F} = \{U_1, \dots, U_m\}$ be a non-empty finite collection of subposets of $V$. Suppose that:
1. *Covering:* $V = U_1 \cup \cdots \cup U_m$.
2. *Downward Closure Compatibility:* For any $a, b \in V$ with $a \le b$, if $a \in U_i$ and $b \in U_j$, then either $a, b \in U_i$ or $a, b \in U_j$. (This holds in particular if each $U_i$ is a downward closed subposet).
3. *Intersection Contractibility:* Any non-empty intersection of elements in $\mathcal{F}$ is a weakly contractible subposet of $V$.

Then $V$ itself is weakly contractible.
{{< /lemma >}}

{{< proof >}}
We proceed by induction on $m$. The case $m=1$ is trivial.
Assume the statement holds for $m \le k$. Let $W_k = \bigcup_{i=1}^k U_i$. Consider the pushout $P$ in $\mathsf{Cat}$ of the span:
{{< tikzcd >}}
    W_k \cap U_{k+1} \ar[r] \ar[dr,phantom,pos = 0.8,"\ulcorner"] \ar[d] & U_{k+1} \ar[d] \\
    W_k \ar[r] & P.

{{< /tikzcd >}}
We claim that $P$ is equivalent to $V$.
By condition (2), the inclusion functors in the span are fully faithful. As shown in {{< cite haine2025fullyfaithfulfunctorspushouts >}}, fully faithful inclusions ensure that the categorical pushout behaves well:
- By condition (1) and (2), the pushout $P$ has the same underlying set (anima) as the union $V = W_k \cup U_{k+1}$.
- The mapping animae in $P$ agree with those in $V$: for $a, b \in V$, if $a \le b$, the mapping space is contractible; otherwise, it is empty.

Thus, $P \simeq V$.

Now, by the inductive hypothesis, $W_k$ is weakly contractible. The intersection $W_k \cap U_{k+1} = \bigcup_{i=1}^k (U_i \cap U_{k+1})$ satisfies the conditions of the lemma for the collection $\{U_i \cap U_{k+1}\}$, so it is also weakly contractible. Since $U_{k+1}$ is contractible by (3), $V$ (being the homotopy pushout of contractible spaces) is weakly contractible.
{{< /proof >}}

Now we apply this to the specific geometry of the simplex category.

{{< lemma id="lem-coinitial" >}}
Let $\Delta^{\operatorname{inj}}$ be the subcategory of $\Delta$ consisting of injective maps. The functor
\[
\iota \colon \Delta^{\operatorname{inj}}_{/[n]} \to \Delta_{\leq n}
\]
defined by sending $([m], [m] \hookrightarrow [n])$ to $[m]$ is coinitial.
{{< /lemma >}}

{{< proof >}}
By Quillen's Theorem A, it suffices to show that for any $[k] \in \Delta_{\leq n}$, the slice category
\[
Q_{n,k} \coloneqq \Delta^{\operatorname{inj}}_{/[n]} \times_{\Delta_{\leq n}} (\Delta_{\leq n})_{/[k]}
\]
is weakly contractible.

Explicitly, objects in $Q_{n,k}$ are pairs $(\beta, f)$, where $\beta \colon [m] \hookrightarrow [n]$ is an injective map and $f \colon [m] \to [k]$ is a map in $\Delta_{\leq n}$.
Since $\beta$ is injective, it is uniquely determined by its image $I \subseteq [n]$. Thus, we can identify objects of $Q_{n,k}$ with pairs $(I, f)$ where $I \subseteq [n]$ is a subset and $f \colon I \to [k]$ is an order-preserving map (where we identify $I$ with $[|I|-1]$ via the unique order isomorphism).

Let $O_{n,k}$ be the set of all maps $[n] \to [k]$. We equip $O_{n,k}$ with the *alphabetic order* $\le$ (a reverse lexicographical order): we say $g < h$ if there exists some $i \in [n]$ such that 
\[
    g(n)=h(n), \dots, g(i+1)=h(i+1) \quad \text{and} \quad g(i) < h(i).
\]
This defines a total order on $O_{n,k}$.

For each $\phi \in O_{n,k}$, let $U_{\phi} \subseteq Q_{n,k}$ be the subposet of elements $(I, f)$ such that the composite map $([n] \twoheadrightarrow I \xrightarrow{f} [k])$ is $\le \phi$ in the pointwise order.
Each $U_{\phi}$ has a terminal object (the pair corresponding to the largest subset $I$ compatible with the constraints) and is thus contractible.

We filter $Q_{n,k}$ by the subposets $V_{\phi} \coloneqq \bigcup_{\psi \le \phi} U_{\psi}$.
We prove that each $V_{\phi}$ is contractible by induction on the alphabetic order.
- *Base case:* $V_{(0,\dots,0)}$ is contractible.
- *Inductive step:* Let $\phi$ be a map and $\phi' = \phi + 1$ be its successor in the alphabetic order. We have a pushout square:
{{< tikzcd >}}
    V_{\phi} \cap U_{\phi'} \ar[r] \ar[dr,phantom,pos = 0.8,"\ulcorner"] \ar[d] & U_{\phi'} \ar[d] \\
    V_{\phi} \ar[r] & V_{\phi'}.

{{< /tikzcd >}}
It suffices to show the intersection $V_{\phi} \cap U_{\phi'}$ is contractible.

*Analyzing the intersection:*  
Let $i$ be the largest index such that $\phi(i) < k$ (the pivot for the successor). Then the successor $\phi'$ is given by:
\[
    \phi'(t) = \begin{cases} 
        \phi(t) & \text{if } t > i \\
        \phi(t) + 1 & \text{if } t = i \\
        0 & \text{if } t < i.
    \end{cases}
\]
The intersection $V_{\phi} \cap U_{\phi'}$ consists of pairs $(I, f)$ compatible with $\phi'$ that are also pointwise $\le \psi$ for some $\psi \le \phi$.
As shown in Wu, this intersection decomposes nicely as a union of principal ideals:
\[
V_{\phi} \cap U_{\phi'} = \bigcup_{c \in S(\phi)} P_{\le ([n] \setminus \{c\})},
\]
where $S(\phi) \subseteq [n]$ is a specific set of indices determined by the descent of $\phi'$. An index $c$ belongs to $S(\phi)$ if and only if $c=i$, or $c > i$ and $\phi'(c-1) < \phi'(c)$.

Crucially, since $k \le n$, the set $S(\phi)$ is not the entire set $[n]$. Thus, the total intersection of these principal ideals corresponds to the ideal generated by $[n] \setminus S(\phi)$, which is non-empty.

Therefore, the collection of ideals $\{ P_{\le ([n] \setminus \{c\})} \}_{c \in S(\phi)}$ satisfies the conditions of Lemma “Union of Contractible Posets” (any intersection is a principal ideal, hence contractible). We conclude that $V_{\phi} \cap U_{\phi'}$ is contractible, and by induction, $Q_{n,k}$ is contractible.
{{< /proof >}}

## The Cube Lemma in Stable Categories

{{< definition title="Cubes in a stable category" >}}
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a stable category. A *cube* is a functor $D \colon \mathcal{P}(S) \to \mathcal{C}$ for some finite set $S$.
- We say $D$ is *cartesian* (or a limit diagram) if the object $D(\emptyset)$ is the limit of $D|_{\mathcal{P}(S) \setminus \{\emptyset\}}$.
- We say $D$ is *cocartesian* (or a colimit diagram) if the object $D(S)$ is the colimit of $D|_{\mathcal{P}(S) \setminus \{S\}}$.
{{< /definition >}}

{{< lemma id="lem-cube" title="The cube lemma" >}}
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a stable category and $D \colon \mathcal{P}(S) \to \mathcal{C}$ a cube. The following are equivalent:
1. $D$ is cartesian.
2. $D$ is cocartesian.
{{< /lemma >}}

{{< proof >}}
This is a standard result in higher algebra. The core idea is to define the *total fiber* (denoted $\operatorname{tfib}(D)$) and the *total cofiber* (denoted $\operatorname{tcof}(D)$).
- $D$ is cartesian $\iff \operatorname{tfib}(D) \simeq 0$.
- $D$ is cocartesian $\iff \operatorname{tcof}(D) \simeq 0$.
In a stable category, there is a natural equivalence $\operatorname{tfib}(D) \simeq \operatorname{tcof}(D)[-|S|]$, where $|S|$ is the cardinality of $S$. Thus, the vanishing of one implies the vanishing of the other.
{{< /proof >}}

## Proof of Lemma “Kan extension equivalence”

{{< proof >}}
Let $F \colon \Delta_{+,\leq n}^{\operatorname{op}} \to \mathcal{C}$ be the functor. We interpret the two conditions:

*1. Analysis of the Left Kan Extension.*  
Condition (1) states that $F$ is a left Kan extension at the object $[-1]$. By definition, this means
\[
F([-1]) \simeq \operatorname{colim}_{\alpha: [k] \to [-1]} F([k]),
\]
where the colimit is over the slice category $\Delta_{\le n}^{\operatorname{op}}$.
By Lemma “Coinitiality of the Injective Slice”, the inclusion $\Delta^{\operatorname{inj}}_{/[n]} \to \Delta_{\leq n}$ is coinitial. Note that $\Delta^{\operatorname{inj}}_{/[n]}$ is isomorphic to $\mathcal{P}([n]) \setminus \{\emptyset\}$.
Thus, condition (1) is equivalent to saying that the restriction of $F$ to the $(n+1)$-cube $\mathcal{P}([n])$ is a *cocartesian* (where the colimit cone is the value at $\emptyset \subseteq [n]$, corresponding to $[-1]$).

*2. Analysis of the Right Kan Extension.*  
Condition (2) states that $F$ is a right Kan extension at the object $[n]$. The relevant index category is the slice of $\Delta_{+, \le n-1}^{\operatorname{op}}$ under $[n]$, which essentially corresponds to $\Delta_{\leq n}$ (mapping into $[n]$).
Using Lemma “Coinitiality of the Injective Slice” again (in the dual or shifted context), we can identify this limit with a limit over the same combinatorial structure $\Delta^{\operatorname{inj}}_{/[n]} \cong \mathcal{P}([n])$.
Thus, condition (2) is equivalent to saying that the restriction of $F$ to the cube is a *limit diagram* (where the limit cone is the value at $[n]$).

*3. Conclusion.*  
We have identified both conditions with properties of a single cube diagram formed by restricted values of $F$.
- Left Kan Extension $\iff$ The cube is cocartesian.
- Right Kan Extension $\iff$ The cube is cartesian.
By the Cube Lemma (stability), these two conditions are equivalent.

# The Proof of the Stable Dold–Kan Correspondence {#Stable-DK}

In this chapter, we provide a complete proof of the stable Dold–Kan correspondence.

Our proof strategy relies on constructing a “bridge” between the two worlds. Specifically, we will:
1. Construct a chain of functors connecting the category of simplicial objects, $\operatorname{Fun}(\Delta^{\operatorname{op}}, \mathcal{C})$, with the category of filtered objects, $\operatorname{Fun}(\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}, \mathcal{C})$.
2. Show that every functor in this chain is an equivalence of categories.

## Preliminaries: The Skeletal Filtration

Before diving into the formal construction of the bridge categories, let us ground our intuition in the geometry of simplicial objects. This will explain *why* the proof takes the form it does.

Recall that for any simplicial object $X_{\bullet} \in \operatorname{Fun}(\Delta^{\operatorname{op}}, \mathcal{C})$, we can define its *$n$-skeleton* $\operatorname{sk}_n X$. Categorically, this is the Left Kan Extension of the restriction of $X$ to the truncated category $\Delta_{\le n}^{\operatorname{op}}$ along the inclusion:
\[
\operatorname{sk}_n X \coloneqq \operatorname{Lan}_{\Delta_{\le n}^{\operatorname{op}} \hookrightarrow \Delta^{\operatorname{op}}} (X|_{\Delta_{\le n}^{\operatorname{op}}}).
\]
The sequence of skeletons provides a natural filtration of $X$:
\[
\operatorname{sk}_0 X \to \operatorname{sk}_1 X \to \operatorname{sk}_2 X \to \cdots \to \operatorname{colim}_n \operatorname{sk}_n X \simeq X.
\]

### The Geometric Intuition

Why is this relevant to Dold–Kan? In the classical case (e.g., simplicial sets), $\operatorname{sk}_n X$ is obtained from $\operatorname{sk}_{n-1} X$ by attaching non-degenerate $n$-simplices via a pushout square:
{{< tikzcd >}}
    \coprod \partial \Delta^n \ar[r] \ar[dr,phantom,pos = 0.8,"\ulcorner"] \ar[d] & \operatorname{sk}_{n-1} X \ar[d] \\
    \coprod \Delta^n \ar[r] & \operatorname{sk}_n X.

{{< /tikzcd >}}

## Step 1: Building the Bridge Categories

To make the skeletal intuition precise, we introduce two index categories: $\mathcal{J}$ and $\mathcal{J}_+$.

### The Category $\mathcal{J}_+$

We define $\mathcal{J}_+$ as the full subcategory of $\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0} \times \Delta^{\operatorname{op}}_+$ spanned by pairs $(n,[m])$ satisfying $m \leq n$.
Here, $\Delta^{\operatorname{op}}_+$ is the augmented simplex category (including $[-1]$).
- The first coordinate $n \in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0}$ represents the *filtration stage* (related to the $n$-skeleton).
- The second coordinate $[m] \in \Delta^{\operatorname{op}}_+$ represents the *simplicial degree*.

Intuitively, an object $(n,[m])$ corresponds to the term $(X_m)$ sitting inside the $n$-skeleton. The condition $m \leq n$ reflects that the $n$-skeleton is determined by simplices of dimension up to $n$.

The picture to have in mind is a large commutative diagram:
{{< tikzcd >}}
    \cdots & {(2,[-1])} & {(1,[-1])} & {(0,[-1])} \\
    \cdots & {(2,[0])} & {(1,[0])} & {(0,[0])} \\
    \cdots & {(2,[1])} & {(1,[1])} \\
    \cdots & {(2,[2])}

    \arrow[from=1-3, to=1-2]
    \arrow[from=1-4, to=1-3]
    \arrow[from=2-2, to=1-2]
    \arrow[from=2-2, to=2-1]
    \arrow[from=2-2, to=3-2]
    \arrow[from=2-3, to=1-3]

### The Category $\mathcal{J}$ and the Functor Chain

In parallel, we define $\mathcal{J}$ as the full subcategory of $\mathcal{J}_+$ spanned by pairs $(n,[m])$ where $0 \leq m \leq n$ (excluding the bottom row $m=-1$). This encodes the skeleton data *without* the geometric realization.

We define $\operatorname{Fun}^0(\mathcal{J},\mathcal{C})$ to be the full subcategory of $\operatorname{Fun}(\mathcal{J},\mathcal{C})$ spanned by functors $F$ satisfying the following *stability condition*:
- For every $s \leq m \leq n$, the image of the natural map $(m,[s]) \to (n,[s])$ is an equivalence in $\mathcal{C}$.

Similarly, we define $\operatorname{Fun}^0(\mathcal{J}_+,\mathcal{C})$ for functors $F_+ \colon \mathcal{J}_+ \to \mathcal{C}$ satisfying the same stability condition. Additionally, we require that $F_+$ is a *Left Kan Extension* of its restriction to $\mathcal{J}$. This condition formally encodes that the bottom row objects $(n, [-1])$ are geometric realizations (colimits) of the columns above them.

This setup yields a diagram of categories:
\[
\operatorname{Fun}(\Delta^{\operatorname{op}},\mathcal{C}) \xrightarrow{G} \operatorname{Fun}^0(\mathcal{J},\mathcal{C}) \xleftarrow{G'} \operatorname{Fun}^0(\mathcal{J}_+,\mathcal{C}) \xrightarrow{G''} \operatorname{Fun}(\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0},\mathcal{C}).
\]
Here:
- $G$ is induced by the projection $p \colon \mathcal{J} \to \Delta^{\operatorname{op}}$.
- $G'$ is the restriction functor.
- $G''$ is the restriction to the bottom row $\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0} \hookrightarrow \mathcal{J}_+$ via $n \mapsto (n,[-1])$.

Our goal is to show that $G$, $G'$, and $G''$ are equivalences.

## Step 2: Proving the Equivalences

### The Functor $G$ is an equivalence

We first show that $G$ is an equivalence. The strategy is to express $G$ as a limit of equivalences $G_k$.

Define the “truncated” index categories:
- $\mathcal{J}^{\leq k}$: the full subcategory of $\mathcal{J}$ spanned by pairs $(n,[m])$ where $m \leq n \leq k$.
- $\mathcal{J}^{k}$: the full subcategory of $\mathcal{J}$ spanned by pairs $(n,[m])$ where $m \leq n = k$.

Note that the projection $p$ restricts to an equivalence $\mathcal{J}^k \simeq \Delta_{\leq k}^{\operatorname{op}}$.

We aim to show an equivalence:
\[
\operatorname{Fun}^0(\mathcal{J}^{\leq k},\mathcal{C}) \xrightarrow{\sim} \operatorname{Fun}(\mathcal{J}^k,\mathcal{C}).
\]
Consider the right Kan extension along the fully faithful inclusion $\iota \colon \mathcal{J}^{k} \hookrightarrow \mathcal{J}^{\leq k}$:
{{< tikzcd >}}
    \mathcal{J}^{k} \ar[d,hook,"\iota"'] \ar[dr,"H"]\\
    \mathcal{J}^{\leq k} \ar[r,"\operatorname{Ran}_{\iota} H"'] & \mathcal{C}.

{{< /tikzcd >}}
This induces a fully faithful functor $\iota_* \colon \operatorname{Fun}(\mathcal{J}^{k},\mathcal{C}) \to \operatorname{Fun}(\mathcal{J}^{\leq k},\mathcal{C})$. It remains to identify the essential image of $\iota_*$ with $\operatorname{Fun}^0(\mathcal{J}^{\leq k},\mathcal{C})$.

For any $s \leq m \leq n \leq k$, observe that the under-categories satisfy $\mathcal{J}^k_{(m,[s])/} \simeq \mathcal{J}^k_{(n,[s])/}$. Consequently, the limit diagrams defining the right Kan extension at $(m,[s])$ and $(n,[s])$ are isomorphic.
Since $\mathcal{C}$ is stable (and thus admits finite limits), the pointwise formula for the Right Kan Extension implies that the map
\[
\operatorname{Ran}_{\iota}H ((m,[s])) \to \operatorname{Ran}_{\iota}H ((n,[s]))
\]
is an equivalence. Thus, the image of $\iota_*$ lies in $\operatorname{Fun}^0(\mathcal{J}^{\leq k},\mathcal{C})$.
Conversely, for any $F \in \operatorname{Fun}^0(\mathcal{J}^{\leq k},\mathcal{C})$, one can check that $F \simeq \operatorname{Ran}_{\iota}(F|_{\mathcal{J}^k})$.

Thus, we obtain a sequence of equivalences:
\[
G_k \colon \operatorname{Fun}(\Delta_{\leq k}^{\operatorname{op}},\mathcal{C}) \xrightarrow{\sim} \operatorname{Fun}(\mathcal{J}^{k},\mathcal{C}) \xrightarrow{\sim} \operatorname{Fun}^0(\mathcal{J}^{\leq k},\mathcal{C}).
\]
Taking the limit as $k \to \infty$, we have $G \simeq \lim_{k} G_k$. Since a limit of equivalences is an equivalence, $G$ is an equivalence.

### The Functor $G'$ is an equivalence

The inclusion $\mathcal{J} \hookrightarrow \mathcal{J}_+$ is fully faithful.
For any $(n, [-1]) \in \mathcal{J}_+$, the slice category $\mathcal{J}_{/(n,[-1])}$ is finite. Since $\mathcal{C}$ admits finite colimits, the Left Kan Extension exists.
By definition, $\operatorname{Fun}^0(\mathcal{J}_+,\mathcal{C})$ consists precisely of those functors which are Left Kan extensions of their restriction to $\mathcal{J}$. Since fully faithful embeddings induce fully faithful restriction functors onto the subcategory of Kan extensions, $G'$ is an equivalence.

### The Functor $G''$ is an equivalence

Finally, we show that $G''$ is an equivalence. This is the subtlest part, which relies on our Technical Lemma.

Let $\mathcal{J}_+^{\leq k}$ be the full subcategory of $\mathcal{J}_+$ spanned by $(n,[m])$ where either $m \leq n \leq k$ or $m = -1$.
Let $\mathcal{D}(k) \coloneqq \operatorname{Fun}^0(\mathcal{J}_+^{\leq k}, \mathcal{C})$ be the category of functors satisfying the standard stability condition and the Left Kan Extension condition at $(n,[-1])$ for $n \le k$.

We have a limit decomposition:
\[
\operatorname{Fun}^0(\mathcal{J}_+,\mathcal{C}) \simeq \lim \left( \cdots \to \mathcal{D}(k) \to \mathcal{D}(k-1) \to \cdots \to \mathcal{D}(-1) \right),
\]
where $\mathcal{D}(-1) \simeq \operatorname{Fun}(\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}, \mathcal{C})$.
It suffices to show that the restriction map $\mathcal{D}(k) \to \mathcal{D}(k-1)$ is an equivalence for all $k \geq 0$.

We decompose this restriction into two steps:
\[
\mathcal{D}(k) \xrightarrow{\theta} \mathcal{D}'(k) \xrightarrow{\theta'} \mathcal{D}(k-1).
\]
Here, $\mathcal{D}'(k)$ is defined on the domain $\mathcal{J}_{0}^{\leq k} \coloneqq \mathcal{J}_+^{\leq k} \setminus \{(k,[k])\}$.
1. *The map $\theta'$:* A functor in $\mathcal{D}'(k)$ is determined by its restriction to $\mathcal{J}_+^{\leq k-1}$ plus the Left Kan extension condition at $(k,[-1])$. Since the Kan extension is unique, $\theta'$ is an equivalence.
2. *The map $\theta$:* This restricts a functor from $\mathcal{J}_+^{\leq k}$ to $\mathcal{J}_0^{\leq k}$. To show this is an equivalence, we need to show that the value at the missing point $(k,[k])$ is uniquely determined.

By definition of $\mathcal{D}(k)$, any $F \in \mathcal{D}(k)$ is a *Left Kan Extension* of $F|_{\mathcal{J}^{\leq k}}$.
Observe that $\mathcal{J}^k \simeq \Delta_{\leq k}^{\operatorname{op}}$ is coinitial in the diagram computing this Kan extension at $(k,[-1])$.

*Crucially, we invoke our Technical Lemma (“Kan extension equivalence”):* Since $\mathcal{C}$ is stable, being a Left Kan Extension from $\Delta_{\leq k}^{\operatorname{op}}$ is equivalent to being a *Right Kan Extension* from $\Delta_{+,\leq k-1}^{\operatorname{op}} \simeq \mathcal{J}_+^{k-1}$.

Note that $\mathcal{J}_+^{k-1} \subseteq \mathcal{J}_0^{\leq k}$. This means the value at $(k,[k])$ is determined by a Right Kan extension from data we already possess in $\mathcal{D}'(k)$. Thus, $\theta$ is an equivalence.

Since both steps are equivalences, $G''$ is an equivalence.

### Alternative Perspective on $G$

There is a more high-level way to see that $G$ is an equivalence using the language of localizations.

We can regard $\operatorname{Fun}^0(\mathcal{J},\mathcal{C})$ as the functor category $\operatorname{Fun}(\mathcal{J}[W^{-1}],\mathcal{C})$, where $W$ is the set of morphisms $\{(m,[s]) \to (n,[s]) \mid s\leq m \leq n\}$ that we require to be inverted.

Consider the forgetful functor $p' \colon \mathcal{J} \to \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$ given by $(m,[n]) \mapsto m$.
Observe that $p'$ is a cocartesian fibration, and $W$ is precisely the collection of $p'$-cocartesian morphisms.
By the fundamental theorem of $\infty$-categorical colimits (or the description of localizations of cocartesian fibrations), we have an equivalence:
\[
\mathcal{J}[W^{-1}] \simeq \operatorname{colim}_{n \in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0}} (\mathcal{J}_n),
\]
where $\mathcal{J}_n$ is the fiber over $n$. Since each fiber $\mathcal{J}_n \simeq \Delta_{\leq n}^{\operatorname{op}}$, the colimit is precisely $\Delta^{\operatorname{op}}$.
Thus, $\operatorname{Fun}^0(\mathcal{J},\mathcal{C}) \simeq \operatorname{Fun}(\Delta^{\operatorname{op}}, \mathcal{C})$.

# Application: Descent and Comonadicity {#chap:application}

In the final part of this talk, we apply the stable Dold–Kan correspondence to prove a fundamental result in stable homotopy theory: the *descendable Barr–Beck theorem*. This result provides a powerful criterion for recovering a category $\mathcal{C}$ from the category of modules over a “nice” algebra $A$.

Unless otherwise specified, let $\mathcal{C}$ be a stable symmetric monoidal category where the tensor product preserves colimits.

## The Descent Problem

Let $A \in \mathsf{CAlg}(\mathcal{C})$ be a commutative algebra. We have a standard adjunction:
{{< tikzcd >}}
    {\mathcal{C}} \ar[r,shift left=3,"-\otimes A"]\ar[r,phantom,"\bot"] & \mathsf{Mod}_A(\mathcal{C}) \ar[l,shift left=3,"\operatorname{Forget}"]

{{< /tikzcd >}}
The central question of descent theory is: *When is the comparison functor from $\mathcal{C}$ to the category of coalgebras over the associated comonad an equivalence?*
In geometric terms, this asks if the map $A \to A \otimes A$ satisfies effective descent.

According to the *Lurie–Barr–Beck theorem*, this equivalence holds if and only if two conditions are met:
1. *Conservativity:* The functor $-\otimes A$ is conservative (i.e., it reflects equivalences).
2. *Convergence:* For any cosimplicial object split by $-\otimes A$, the totalization converges to the original object.

## Descendable Algebras

We focus on a broad class of algebras where “convergence” is guaranteed by “nilpotence”.

{{< definition id="def-descendable" title="Descendable" >}}
For every object $A \in \mathcal{C}$, we denote by $\langle A \rangle \subseteq \mathcal{C}$ (or $\operatorname{Thick}^{\otimes}(A)$) the smallest full subcategory containing $A$ which is stable under:
- Finite limits and colimits (cofiber sequences),
- Retracts,
- Tensor products with arbitrary objects of $\mathcal{C}$.
We say that a commutative algebra $A$ is *descendable* if $\mathbb{1}_{\mathcal{C}}$ is in $\langle A \rangle$.
{{< /definition >}}

## Key Tool: Stable Dold–Kan

The convergence condition involves the *cobar construction* $\operatorname{CB}^{\bullet}(A)$:
{{< tikzcd >}}
    \mathbb{1} \ar[r] & A \ar[r,shift left] \ar[r,shift right] & A \otimes A \ar[r,shift left = 2] \ar[r,shift right = 2]\ar[r] & \cdots

{{< /tikzcd >}}
Checking whether $\operatorname{Tot}(\operatorname{CB}^{\bullet}(A)) \simeq \mathbb{1}$ is typically difficult. 

However, the *stable Dold–Kan correspondence* allows us to translate this cosimplicial problem into a much simpler filtration problem.

Let $A \in \mathsf{Alg}(\mathcal{C})$ be an associative algebra of $\mathcal{C}$.
{{< construction title="Adams Tower" >}}
Let $M \in \mathcal{C}$ be an object. We can form a tower in $\mathcal{C}$
\[
\cdots \to T_2(A,M) \to T_1(A,M) \to T_0(A,M) \simeq M
\]
as follows:
1. $T_1(A,M)$ is the fiber of the morphism $M \to M \otimes A$ induced by $\mathbb{1}_{\mathcal{C}} \to A$, so that $T_1(A,M)$ admits a natural morphism to $M$.
2. More generally, $T_i(A,M) \coloneqq T_1(A,T_{i - 1}(A,M))$, which admits a natural morphism to $T_{i-1}(A,M)$.
Inductively, this defines the functors $T_i$ and the desired tower.
We will call this the *$A$-Adams tower* of $M$.
Observe that the $A$-Adams tower of $M$ is simply the tensor product of $M$ with the $A$-Adams tower of $\mathbb{1}_{\mathcal{C}}$.
{{< /construction >}}

{{< remark id="rmk-adams" title="Alternate description" >}}
We can write the construction of the Adams tower in another way.
Let $I = \operatorname{fib}(\mathbb{1}_{\mathcal{C}} \to A)$, so that $I$ is a nonunital associative algebra in $\mathcal{C}$ equipped with a morphism $I \to \mathbb{1}_{\mathcal{C}}$.
In fact, we can get a tower
\[
    \cdots \to I^{\otimes n} \to I^{\otimes (n-1)} \to \cdots \to I^{\otimes 2} \to I \to \mathbb{1}_{\mathcal{C}},
\]
and this is precisely the $A$-Adams tower $\{T_i(A,\mathbb{1}_{\mathcal{C}})\}_{i \geq 0}$.
The $A$-Adams tower for $M$ is obtained by tensoring this with $M$.
{{< /remark >}}

{{< theorem id="thm-translate" title="DK translation: cobar ↔ Adams" >}}
Let $I = \operatorname{fib}(\mathbb{1} \to A)$ be the fiber of the unit map. The *cobar construction* corresponds to the *Adams tower* via the stable Dold–Kan correspondence. Specifically, we have a natural equivalence:
\[
\operatorname{Tot}_n(\operatorname{CB}^{\bullet}(A)) \simeq \operatorname{cofib}\left(I^{\otimes(n+1)} \to \mathbb{1}\right),
\]
where $\operatorname{Tot}_n(\operatorname{CB}^{\bullet}(A)) \coloneqq \operatorname{Tot}(\operatorname{CB}^{\bullet}(A)\mid_{\Delta_{\leq n}})$.
{{< /theorem >}}

This translation implies a crucial fact: *The totalization converges ($\operatorname{Tot} \simeq \mathbb{1}$) if and only if the Adams tower vanishes (i.e., is contractible).*

## From Descendability to Nilpotence

We now establish the link between our algebraic definition (descendability) and the geometric convergence (Adams tower).

{{< theorem title="Nilpotence theorem" >}}
A commutative algebra $A$ is descendable if and only if the Adams tower is *nilpotent*.
That is, the tower $\{I^{\otimes s}\}_{s \ge 0}$ is pro-zero: there exists an integer $N$ such that the transition map $I^{\otimes (s+N)} \to I^{\otimes s}$ is null-homotopic for any $s$.
{{< /theorem >}}

{{< proof title="Sketch" >}}
Let's check the two implications separately.

*($\Rightarrow$) Descendability implies Nilpotence:*  
Let $\mathcal{C}_{\text{nil}}$ be the class of objects $M$ for which the $A$-based Adams tower vanishes (i.e., acts like zero).
1. First, observe that $A \otimes I \simeq 0$. As we discussed, the unit map $A \to A \otimes A$ is a split monomorphism (via the multiplication map), so its fiber $A \otimes I$ is contractible. Consequently, $A \in \mathcal{C}_{\text{nil}}$.
2. One can verify that $\mathcal{C}_{\text{nil}}$ forms a thick tensor-ideal. Since $A$ is descendable, we know that the unit lies in the thick ideal generated by $A$, i.e., $\mathbb{1} \in \langle A \rangle \subseteq \mathcal{C}_{\text{nil}}$.
3. Therefore, the Adams tower for $\mathbb{1}$ itself must be pro-zero.

*($\Leftarrow$) Nilpotence implies Descendability:*  
Suppose the tower is nilpotent. This means there exists some large $N$ such that the map $I^{\otimes N} \to \mathbb{1}$ is null-homotopic.
Let's look at the cofiber sequence associated with this map:
\[
I^{\otimes N} \xrightarrow{0} \mathbb{1} \longrightarrow \operatorname{cofib}(I^{\otimes N} \to \mathbb{1}).
\]
Since the first map is null, the sequence splits (a standard property in triangulated categories), giving us an equivalence:
\[
\operatorname{cofib}(I^{\otimes N} \to \mathbb{1}) \simeq \mathbb{1} \oplus \left(I^{\otimes N}[1]\right).
\]
In particular, $\mathbb{1}$ is a *retract* of $\operatorname{cofib}(I^{\otimes N} \to \mathbb{1})$.

By Theorem “DK translation: cobar ↔ Adams”, this cofiber is precisely the partial totalization $\operatorname{Tot}_{N-1}(\operatorname{CB}^{\bullet}(A))$.
This object is built from finite limits of $A, A^{\otimes 2}, \dots, A^{\otimes N}$, all of which live in $\langle A \rangle$.

Since $\langle A \rangle$ is closed under retracts, we conclude that $\mathbb{1} \in \langle A \rangle$. Thus, $A$ is descendable.
{{< /proof >}}

### Geometric interpretation: Nilpotent thickening

This result offers a profound geometric intuition for descent in stable homotopy theory.
Classically, for a map to satisfy effective descent (like a faithfully flat map in algebraic geometry), we usually require the cobar construction to be acyclic.
However, in the stable setting, descendability is a relaxation of this condition.
- It asserts that the error term (the ideal $I$) is not necessarily zero, but it is *nilpotent* (the tower $\{I^{\otimes s}\}$ is pro-zero).
- Geometrically, this means the map $\operatorname{Spec}(A) \to \operatorname{Spec}(\mathbb{1})$ behaves like a *nilpotent thickening*.

In classical algebraic geometry, a scheme and its reduction share the same underlying topological space; nilpotent elements only add “infinitesimal” structure without changing the topology.
Similarly, a stable category $\mathcal{C}$ is essentially unchanged if we thicken the unit by a nilpotent ideal.
The stable Dold–Kan correspondence is the essential dictionary that allows us to see this “nilpotence” hidden inside the simplicial structure of descent.

## The Main Result: Descendable Barr–Beck

Finally, combining these insights, we prove the main theorem.
{{< theorem id="thm-descendable" title="Descendable Barr–Beck theorem" >}}
Let $A \in \mathsf{CAlg}(\mathcal{C})$ be a descendable commutative algebra.
Then the adjunction $-\otimes A : \mathcal{C} \rightleftarrows \mathsf{Mod}_A(\mathcal{C})$ exhibits $\mathcal{C}$ as *comonadic* over $\mathsf{Mod}_{A}(\mathcal{C})$.
In particular, for any $M \in \mathcal{C}$, we have a canonical equivalence:
\[
M \xrightarrow{\sim} \operatorname{Tot}\left( M \otimes \operatorname{CB}^{\bullet}(A) \right).
\]
{{< /theorem >}}

{{< proof >}}
We verify the conditions of Lurie–Barr–Beck Theorem ({{< cite HA "Theorem 4.7.3.5" >}}):
1. *Conservativity:* Suppose $M \otimes A \simeq 0$.
Let $\mathcal{Z} = \{X \in \mathcal{C} \mid M \otimes X \simeq 0\}$.
One can verify that $\mathcal{Z}$ is stable under finite limits/colimits, retracts, and tensor products.
Since $A \in \mathcal{Z}$ (by assumption) and $A$ is descendable, we have $\mathbb{1} \in \langle A \rangle \subseteq \mathcal{Z}$.
Thus $M \simeq M \otimes \mathbb{1} \simeq 0$.

2. *Convergence:* We need to show that for any $M$, the natural map $M \to \operatorname{Tot}(M \otimes \operatorname{CB}^{\bullet}(A))$ is an equivalence.
By the Dold–Kan translation, the fiber of this map is the limit of the Adams tower: $\lim_s (M \otimes I^{\otimes s})$.
Since $A$ is descendable, the nilpotence theorem ensures that the tower $\{I^{\otimes s}\}$ is pro-zero.
Thus, the inverse limit of the tower is zero.
Consequently, the map to the totalization is an equivalence.
