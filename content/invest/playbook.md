> **Disclaimer:** This is my personal learning log and decision framework. Nothing here is financial advice.  
> **Style:** long-term (months to years), no leverage, low-frequency execution.

---

## 1. Scope & Objectives

**Time horizon:** months to years  
**Primary objective:** sustainable long-term compounding with explainable decisions  
**Secondary objective:** keep investing in the background (study/life first)

---

## 2. Non-Negotiables

- **No leverage**
- **No high-frequency trading**
- Do not change long-term structure due to short-term volatility
- Avoid complexity for the sake of being “smart”
- Default to **low action** when evidence is weak

---

## 3. Portfolio Architecture

### 3.1 Core ETFs = Market Tracking (Beta Engine)
The core sleeve is designed to **follow broad markets** with low friction.
This is the default compounding engine.

Typical instruments:
- **VOO / RSP** (US large-cap / S&P 500 exposure with different weighting)
- **VEU** (ex-US equity exposure)
- **SCHG** (growth tilt)

### 3.2 Individual Stocks = Defense + Opportunities (Satellite Sleeve)
Stocks are not for market tracking. They serve two roles:

1) **Defense**  
   Resilient businesses meant to stabilize the portfolio under stress  
   (defensive ≠ no drawdown; the real defense is **sizing + emotional distance**).

2) **Opportunities**  
   Small, controlled bets on clear mispricing or structural themes.

**Default filter (to avoid randomness):**
- Prefer **high-quality, well-covered mega-caps** temporarily weak / range-bound  
  over obscure small caps, unless I can articulate a real edge.

### 3.3 Gold + Cash = Risk Tools
- **Gold:** diversifier / hedge (can be volatile in the short run)
- **Cash:** optionality + psychological safety; allows patient deployment

---

## 4. Allocation Bands (targets, not fixed weights)

I manage allocation by **bands** rather than exact weights.

- **Core ETFs (Market):** **35–60%**
- **Stocks (Defense + Opportunities):** **20–50%**
- **Gold:** **8–15%**
- **Cash:** **5–30%**

**Important:** Bands are not meant to hit upper bounds simultaneously.  
**Priority rule:** keep the **Core** healthy; correct drift mainly via **cash flows**.

**Neutral baseline (informal):**
- Core ~50%, Stocks ~40%, Gold ~10%, Cash 0–20% (can go higher temporarily after deposits)

---

## 5. Decision Protocol (before any action)

Before any buy/sell/add/reduce decision:

1) **Mirror intent:** structural allocation or emotional reaction?  
2) **New information check:** did the thesis change, or is it just volatility/noise?  
3) **Default action:** if evidence is weak → **no action** or **tiny adjustment using new cash only**

**AI rule (tool, not leader):**
- AI may help research, but it cannot define risk boundaries.
- If I cannot state my cushion (price + sizing + liquidity + falsification) in one sentence, default to **smaller size or no action**.

---

## 6. Rebalancing Rules (low action by default)

### 6.1 Primary method: rebalance via new cash
- Prefer fixing drift by directing **new contributions** into the underweight sleeve.
- Avoid forced selling unless structure is meaningfully broken.

### 6.2 Triggers
- If **Stocks > 50%**:  
  stop adding to stocks; direct new buys to **Core ETFs** until back in range.
- If **Core ETFs < 35%**:  
  new buys go to the **Core** by default (staged entries).
- If **Cash > 30%**:  
  deploy gradually into **Core ETFs** unless a clearly defined opportunity exists.
- If **Gold > 15%**:  
  prefer correcting via cash flows; trim only if necessary to restore structure.

### 6.3 Execution style
- Prefer **3-step entries** over all-in timing:
  - Step 1: starter position
  - Step 2: add if thesis holds and price improves / risk improves
  - Step 3: complete only if evidence strengthens
- Avoid “revenge trades” after losses.

### 6.4 Cooling-off rule after large deposits (hard rule)
After any large deposit:
- **write the plan first**, then deploy
- default first buys go to **Core ETFs**
- any stock entries must be staged (3 steps) and must fit allocation bands

---

## 7. Exception Clause (allowed, but controlled)

I may break a default rule only if:

- the action is **small** (does not alter overall structure),
- the reason is written in **1–2 sentences**:
  - “What hypothesis am I betting on?”
  - “If I’m wrong, how will I exit (time/price/size)?”
- exceptions are reviewed in the next monthly review.

---

## 8. Review Cadence (and attention budget)

- **Log:** short entries written close to the decision (3–10 minutes)
- **Monthly review:** once per month, focusing on:
  - structure drift (Core / Stocks / Gold / Cash)
  - whether any thesis actually changed
  - whether investing is consuming too much attention
- **Lessons:** if a mistake repeats twice, convert it into an explicit rule

**Attention budget (hard constraint):**
- Daily: **15–25 minutes max** (check + log + orders)
- Weekly: **one deep block** (60–90 minutes) for reading + thesis maintenance
- If math/study suffers → reduce investing frequency, not “try harder”.

**Snapshots live in the Log, not the Playbook.**
- See: [/invest/log/](/invest/log/)

## 9. Change Log (Playbook edits)

- **2026-01-30:** initial version; defined Core ETFs as market tracking, stocks as defense/opportunities; established allocation bands and rebalancing rules.
- **2026-01-30 (v1.1):** removed baseline snapshots from Playbook (moved to Log); added deposit cooling-off rule, AI tool constraint, and attention budget.
