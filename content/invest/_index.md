## Start here

- **[Playbook](/invest/playbook/)** — principles, default rules, and an exception clause
- **[Log](/invest/log/)** — time-stamped notes written close to the decision
- **[Lessons](/invest/lessons/)** — rules distilled from repeated mistakes
- **[Monthly Reviews](/invest/reviews/)** — low-frequency calibration of structure & attention cost

## Why I write this

Starting this month, I decided to treat investing as something worth doing **properly**—not something I ignore until volatility forces my attention.

I also admit a human motivation: investing adds a bit of intensity and color to life.  
But this month I learned the cost: investing can silently consume time and attention, and my math study and projects slowed down.

That is why I document and review: to keep investing **explainable, repeatable, and in the background**, so I can go further without sacrificing what matters most.

## Attention boundary (math comes first)

To prevent investing from hijacking my schedule:

- I keep investing in **small, scheduled windows** (and avoid “always-on monitoring”).
- If I break this boundary, it must be written down and reviewed.
- The goal is not to “win every week”, but to remain consistent for years.

## How to read this section

If you’re new:

1. Read the **Playbook** first (the “constitution”).  
2. Scan a few entries in the **Log** (execution in the wild).  
3. Browse **Lessons** (rules backed by concrete cases).  
4. Use **Monthly Reviews** to see how structure and attention drift over time.

## My pre-trade checklist

Before any buy/sell/add/reduce decision, I try to do three things:

- **Mirror intent:** structural allocation move or emotional reaction?  
- **Check for new information:** did the thesis change, or is it just volatility/noise?  
- **Default action:** if evidence is weak, default to **no action** or **tiny adjustments using new cash only**.

## Cadence

- **Log:** not frequent—just honest and close to the decision (3–10 minutes).  
- **Monthly review:** once per month, mainly to detect drift and attention cost.  
- **Lessons:** if the same mistake appears twice, it gets turned into an explicit rule.
