## Abstract

Index investing is not automatically safe if I deploy the core in one shot while ignoring valuation risk. When uncertainty or expensive regimes are plausible, margin of safety must be engineered through pacing: staged entries, cash buffers, and drift correction via cash flows.

## The rule (one sentence)

Build the core, but **do not remove optionality**.

## Why this exists

Core ETFs reduce single-name risk — but they do not eliminate:
- valuation regime risk,
- drawdown risk,
- and (most importantly for me) **execution regret** when I deploy too fast.

If I treat “core building” as permission to do a one-shot deployment, I have simply replaced one kind of risk with another.

## Implementation

**Default constraints**
- Use **staged entries** (starter → add → complete).
- Keep a **cash buffer** when expensive/uncertain regimes are plausible.
- Prefer to correct drift via **cash flows** (new money), not frantic selling/buying.

**Anti-pattern**
- “I know it’s expensive, but it’s the core so it must be safe.”
