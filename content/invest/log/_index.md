## What this is

This log is primarily for my own review. If you’re curious, feel free to read — but it is not a recommendation list.

## Writing rule

- 3–10 minutes per entry
- short sentences
- explicit numbers (price/size)
- one falsification rule

## Entry template

**Intent:** structural vs emotional  
**What changed:** new info vs noise  
**Action:** buy/sell/add/reduce + size  
**Cushion:** price + sizing + liquidity + falsification  
**Plan:** what I do next if right / if wrong  
**Attention cost:** did this steal time from math?
