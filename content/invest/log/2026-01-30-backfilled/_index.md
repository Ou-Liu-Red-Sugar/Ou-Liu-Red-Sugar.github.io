## Why this backfill exists

January contained big emotional swings (especially gold + PGR). If I don’t capture it now, I will rewrite history later.

This entry is a backfilled reconstruction, not a perfect “same-day” diary.

## Core build (late January)

**Intent:** structural (core exposure), but partially emotional (urge to deploy cash).  
**What changed:** I treated “core building” as permission to deploy fast, while selectively ignoring valuation regime risk.  
**Cushion missing:** pacing and optionality.

**Fix:** staged entries + cash buffer.

## Gold spike → refusal to trim → shock drawdown (Jan 29–30)

**Intent:** risk tool (hedge), but became a P&L driver.  
**What changed:** I *felt danger* during the spike but refused to act (anchored to a higher number).  
**Result:** a sharp pullback dominated monthly attribution and increased emotional volatility.

**Fix:** partial profit rule + explicit “maximum acceptable giveback”.

## PGR (defensive ≠ painless)

**Intent:** defense, but position became psychologically heavy.  
**What changed:** “defensive” label did not protect mood; slow grind down is still damage.  
**Action:** reduced concentration to protect structure and attention.

**Fix:** defense is sizing + emotional distance, not labels.

## Attention cost (the real loss)

This month investing consumed too much time and slowed down math study/projects.

**Rule:** keep investing in the background:
- daily 1-2 hours max
- one weekly deep block only
- if math suffers → reduce investing frequency, not “try harder”
