## Abstract

January 2026 was a process month: I built my core ETF exposure, entered a few controlled opportunity positions, and rebalanced a psychologically heavy defensive holding (PGR). Performance was largely driven by gold (XAU.USD), while many other positions stayed red, highlighting how easily one sleeve can dominate the month. The main takeaway is an attention and execution upgrade: enforce a cooling-off rule after deposits, stage entries, and keep investing in the background so math and life remain the priority.

## TL;DR

January was a process month.

- I built my **Core ETF** positions to track the market.
- I used stocks mainly for **defense + opportunities**, but learned that “defensive” can still hurt—especially when a position becomes emotionally loaded (PGR).
- My main mistake: **acting too quickly after depositing new cash**, and **trusting AI too much** without enforcing my own execution rules.
- My key rule update: **stay calm, keep structure, and act only after I have a plan**.

## 1) What happened (context + mental state)

Most of the investment activity clustered in the last two weeks.

Two things dominated my emotions:
- **PGR kept grinding down** despite being labeled “defensive”, creating persistent mood drag.
- **Gold spiked and then pulled back hard**, reminding me that hedges can be volatile too.

I also observed a behavioral risk pattern:
> After a large deposit, my “need to do something” increases.

This month I also paid a real **attention cost**: investing consumed too much time, and my math learning/projects slowed down. That is a problem: investing should support life and study, not compete with them.

## 2) Performance & attribution (what actually moved the month)

### 2.1 Time-weighted performance (behavior check)
- **MTD ended ~+3.29%** after the **Jan 30 shock** (gold-driven), versus **~+5.61%** before that final-day swing.
- On **Jan 30**, my portfolio was about **−1.70%** on the day, while benchmarks moved much less:
  - SPX **−0.43%**
  - NDX **−0.94%**
  - RSP **−0.22%**

Interpretation: the month was **not “index-like”** in risk. A single sleeve (gold) dominated volatility and attribution.

### 2.2 Net asset value bridge (cash flow reality check)
Account-level change was dominated by deposits (as expected this month):

- Start NAV (Jan 1): **27,679.84**
- Deposits / withdrawals: **+16,790.96**
- Dividends: **+462.40**
- Fees & commissions: **−7.03**
- Other (mostly FX / misc): **−827.20**
- Mark-to-market (MTM): **+1,234.24**
- End NAV (Jan 30): **45,333.21**

This is a reminder: **monthly “money-weighted feelings”** are misleading when cash flows are large. The month’s real story is process + volatility management, not just the ending number.

### 2.3 Gold (XAU.USD / GLDM) dominated
- Before Jan 28, **XAU.USD** climbed to around **5417**, and my gold position value peaked around **7400** (about **+27%** at the high).
- On **Jan 29–30**, gold sold off for two consecutive days; **Jan 30** was the main shock day.
- From the peak, gold is down about **−11.34%**, yet it still contributed roughly **~+10%** for the month overall.

Most other sleeves were red over the same period. I can treat part of this as early-stage deployment cost, but only if sizing and falsification rules stay explicit.

## 3) Trades & actions (what I did)

### 3.1 Core ETF building (market tracking)
- **SCHG** — built as a US large-cap growth core sleeve.
- **RSP** — equal-weight S&P 500 exposure as a diversification within US equities.
- **VEU** — ex-US diversification.
- **VOO** — 7 shares @ 639.22 (one-shot entry; core build)

**Process note:** I selectively ignored the risk that US equity valuations can be expensive in regimes like this. Building the “core” is fine; deploying it as a **one-shot** is not fine.

This month produced a new lesson:
- **[Index investing is not automatically safe](/invest/lessons/index-investing-is-not-automatically-safe/)**

### 3.2 Stock sleeve (defense + opportunities)
- **AXP** — 4 shares @ ~361 (starter position; long-term optimism)
- **TLN** — 5 shares @ ~370 (bought on a −10% day; thesis: US power capacity tightness)
- **MSFT** — 6 shares @ ~443 avg (post-earnings sell-off entry; staged-add plan below)
- **NFLX** — 10 shares @ ~84 (starter position; thesis anchored on pricing power + operating leverage)
- **ASIC** — 50 shares @ ~17.74 (observation / small-cap bet)

### 3.3 Risk management / rebalance
- **PGR** — reduced (sold 6 shares around 215-ish area earlier).  
This was a structural move: reduce concentration and reduce psychological load.

## 4) Earnings case studies (why I’m interested in “temporarily weak giants”)

I am increasingly interested in a barbell inside equities:
- **Core ETFs** for market tracking.
- **High-quality mega-caps** when short-term disappointment or regime fear creates better entry terms.

This is NOT a justification to abandon the core. It is a controlled satellite behavior.

### 4.1 Microsoft (MSFT)
From the earnings call transcript highlights:
- Quarterly revenue: **$81.3B**
- “Cloud revenue”: **$51.5B**
- Azure growth: **+39%**
- Capex: **$37.5B**

My interpretation (for my own log, not advice):
- The business is still printing scale + recurring cash flows.
- The market can punish the stock even when fundamentals are solid, which creates “entry windows” — but only if I enforce sizing and pacing.

### 4.2 American Express (AXP)
From transcript highlights:
- 2025 revenue: **$72B** (record)
- 2025 EPS: **$14.83**
- 2026 guide: revenue **+8% to +10%**, EPS **$15.00–$15.50**

My interpretation:
- I like this as a “quality cyclicality” play: strong brand + high-income customer base, but still sensitive to macro regimes.
- Therefore: sizing + staged entries matter more than narratives.

### 4.3 Netflix (NFLX)
From transcript highlights:
- 2025 revenue growth: **+16%**
- 2026 guide: revenue **$51B** (+14%), operating margin **31.5%**, FCF **~$6B**
- Ads: target **~$3B** in 2026

My interpretation:
- This is no longer “just growth”. There is real operating leverage and margin discipline.
- The risk is execution + competitive intensity, so a starter position is fine; overconfidence is not.

## 5) What went wrong (behavioral mistakes)

1) **Over-trusting AI**  
AI is a calculator, not a constitution. I still need my own boundaries and execution protocol.

2) **Not trimming when danger felt obvious (gold spike)**  
I sensed danger but refused to take partial profits while hoping for a round number.

3) **Impulse after depositing new money**  
After adding a large amount of cash, I entered positions too quickly instead of staging entries.  
This increases the risk of “catching a falling knife” and increases emotional load.

---

## 6) What went right (good process moves)

1) **Reducing PGR to protect structure**  
Even if it hurt psychologically, it reduced concentration and improved portfolio ergonomics.

2) **Using research as support, not as leadership**  
Analysis tools are helpful, but execution rules must be mine.

---

## 7) Lessons learned (what I want to remember)

- **Stay calm. Keep structure. Decide, then act.**
- **“Defensive” does not mean “no drawdown.”** The defense is sizing + emotional distance.
- **Cash is not weakness; it’s optionality.** Especially after deposits.
- **Margin of safety must become behavior.**

## 8) Rule updates (process changes after this month)

### 8.1 Cooling-off rule after deposits
After any large deposit:
- write the plan first,
- then enter in **3 steps** (starter → add → complete),
- default first buy goes to **Core ETFs**, not stocks,
- no “one-shot deployment” unless valuation regime is clearly favorable.

### 8.2 Time-box investing (protect math)
I will treat investing as a background system, not a foreground addiction.

New constraint:
- **Daily limit:** 15–25 minutes (log + orders + quick checks).
- **Deep work:** one block per week (60–90 minutes) for reading + thesis maintenance.
- If investing starts to damage math progress, I must reduce activity frequency, not “try harder”.

### 8.3 Staged-add plan (next ~2 months)
This is a mechanical ladder to prevent panic and prevent impulsive over-sizing.

**MSFT plan**
- If **< 420**, add **1 share every $5 down**.
- Guardrails:
  - Only use **new cash** (no forced selling).
  - Hard cap: max additional shares per month (set explicitly).
  - Pause ladder if thesis breaks (e.g., guidance regime change, structural impairment).

**AXP plan**
- If **< 330**, add **1 share every $5 down**.
- Guardrails:
  - Same as above; especially cap total size because cyclicals can stay “cheap” longer than expected.

## 9) What I will study next (outside math)
I will start reading investing books in small, consistent blocks (instead of relying on vibes + AI):
- one “classic” for base principles,
- one “modern” for market structure / incentives / behavioral traps.

The goal is not knowledge accumulation — it’s **execution quality under stress**.
